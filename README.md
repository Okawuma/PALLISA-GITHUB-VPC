#### PALLISA-GITHUB-VPC
##### Project Abstract
###### This project aims to build and provision a Virtual Private Cloud (VPC) for Pallisa General Hospital using Terraform on Amazon Web Services (AWS). The aim is to address the hospital's current IT infrastructure challenges, including data security risks, inefficient resource management, and scalability issues. By leveraging cloud computing and Infrastructure-as-Code (IaC) principles, the project seeks to enhance IT resilience, security, and scalability while reducing operational costs. The objectives include architecting a custom VPC, implementing it using Terraform, enhancing security and compliance with Ugandan healthcare regulations, and improving resource scalability. The project will follow a structured approach, including a literature review, requirements gathering, architecture design, Terraform implementation, and evaluation. The outcome is expected to serve as a benchmark for rural hospitals, demonstrating how cloud computing and IaC tools can transform healthcare infrastructure and improve patient care.
